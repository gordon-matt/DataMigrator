- settings: add theme dropdown for krypton



- order the jobs...

- new job still shows previous job mappings
-dont navigate away from table mappings when saving


- table mappings: when dropdown changed, should clear mappings.. or maybe make combox readonly once mapping started..

-licensing

- Unit Tests!
- Support setting primary keys (and remove default primary key from table creation)


- Support foreign keys? would be complicated .. need to make sure jobs run in correct order or will get errors (missing table/missing data for foreign key)..

- Enable user change field type on UI (mapping)?
- ExtendedProperties IEnumerable<string> on Field?
