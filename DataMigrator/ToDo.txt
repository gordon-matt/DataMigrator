- when add new job, remove all mappings from table control..
	- might be because we keep same control instead of creating new each time
		- need a Reset() method maybe..
		
- add transform actions per column.. example: "Male/Female" can become 1/0 or true/false
	... or replace underscores with spaces.. or whatever
	
- add option: Trim() strings to settings

- Support other delimeters on Csv file
- excel is too slow for inserting data. Is faster even possible with openxml?
- Unit Tests!
- Support setting primary keys (and remove default primary key from table creation)










- Support foreign keys? would be complicated .. need to make sure jobs run in correct order or will get errors (missing table/missing data for foreign key)..

- Enable user change field type on UI (mapping)?
- Convert to WPF app and use ObservableCollection<T> for binding data on Table Mappings form?
- ExtendedProperties IEnumerable<string> on Field?
