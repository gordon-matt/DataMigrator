	... or replace underscores with spaces.. or whatever

- excel is too slow for inserting data. Is faster even possible with openxml?

- Enable user change field type on UI (mapping)?
- Convert to WPF app and use ObservableCollection<T> for binding data on Table Mappings form?
- ExtendedProperties IEnumerable<string> on Field?
