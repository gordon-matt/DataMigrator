- add transform actions per column.. example: "Male/Female" can become 1/0 or true/false
	... or replace underscores with spaces.. or whatever
	

- settings: add theme dropdown for krypton

- Unit Tests!
- Support setting primary keys (and remove default primary key from table creation)

- dmf file to json instead of xml..?

- order the jobs...

- new job still shows previous job mappings
-dont navigate away from table mappings when saving




- Support foreign keys? would be complicated .. need to make sure jobs run in correct order or will get errors (missing table/missing data for foreign key)..

- Enable user change field type on UI (mapping)?
- ExtendedProperties IEnumerable<string> on Field?
