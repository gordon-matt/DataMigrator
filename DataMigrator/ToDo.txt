= schema handling for mysql: currently ignoring schems altogether and just creating the tables in the specified db..
	maybe best approach is to give tables names a prefix for mysql.
		Example: dbo.People -> dbo_People
		Production.Product -> Production_Product
		etc..
	A setting for this would probably be best - MySQL Schema Name Handling (enum options: Ignore = default, UsePrefix, CreateNewDatabase)

-licensing?

- Unit Tests!
- Support setting primary keys (and remove default primary key from table creation)


- Support foreign keys? would be complicated .. need to make sure jobs run in correct order or will get errors (missing table/missing data for foreign key)..

- Enable user change field type on mapping UI?
- ExtendedProperties IEnumerable<string> on Field?
